    $ npm install


## Running the project

    $ node index process.argv[2]

## Duration
  
  The logic around the code took about 4 hours, but the initial research around the use of Puppeteer took a little longer.
  I initially used the English terms and conditions list to test the application but while testing with the other languages i discovered the initial 
  method i was using wasn't consistent so it was not passing for other languages.
